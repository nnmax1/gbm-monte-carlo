<p> A Monte Carlo simulation applies a selected model (that specifies the behavior of an instrument) to a large set of random trials in an attempt to produce a plausible set of possible future outcomes. In regard to simulating stock prices, the most common model is geometric Brownian motion (GBM). GBM assumes that a constant drift is accompanied by random shocks. While the period returns under GBM are normally distributed, the consequent multi-period (for example, ten days) price levels are lognormally distributed. </p>
